  \item \textbf{SOC SIEM Lab – Wazuh (Kali Linux \& Windows 10)} \textit{(SIEM, Incident Response, Log Analysis, FIM)} \hfill Jan 2026\\
  Built and operated a full-scale SIEM lab using Wazuh with Kali Linux as the manager and a Windows 10 endpoint, simulating real SOC workflows.
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Ingested and analyzed 100\% of Windows endpoint security events including authentication logs, file changes, and system activity.
      \item Implemented real-time File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) achieving $>$95\% detection accuracy for file creation, deletion, and modification events.
      \item Generated and investigated SOC alerts mapped to MITRE ATT\&CK techniques, reducing simulated incident detection time by approximately 60\%.
      \item Built SOC dashboards and alert timelines to visualize endpoint risk, enabling faster triage and root-cause analysis.
  \end{itemize}
